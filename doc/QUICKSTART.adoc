GruntWurk Core for Python

== Writing Simple Control Panel Apps

(TBD)

== Writing Apps with Advanced Logging, Advanced Exception Handling, and Advanced Exit Code Handling

(TBD)

== Writing Filters (command-line programs that are "piped" together)

`gwpycore` supports developing command-line only "`filter`" tools.
That means the tool takes data from `stdin`, processes it, and writes it back out to `stdout`.
Along the way, any diagnostic info and/or error messages are written to `stderr`.

*Piping syntax:*

[width="100%",cols=""]
|===
| command > filename                 | Redirects the command's output (`stdout`) to a file (over-writes)
| command >> filename                | APPENDs the command's output (`stdout`) to a file
| command < filename                 | The command takes input from the named file (via `stdin`)
| commandA #|# commandB              | "`Pipes`" the output (`stdout`) from commandA into commandB (as its `stdin`)
| command 2> filename                | Redirects any error messages (`stderr`) into a file
| command 2>> filename               | Appends any error messages (`stderr`) to a file
| command > fileA 2> fileB           | Redirects output (`stdout`) to fileA and redirects any error messages (`stderr`) to fileB
| command > file 2>&1                | Redirects output (`stdout`) to a file and redirects any error messages (`stderr`) into the same file (inter-woven)
| command 2> nul                     | Suppresses error messages by sending them nowhere
| command >nul 2>&1                  | Suppresses both the output and any error messages by sending them nowhere
| command >filename 2> nul           | Redirects output to file but suppress any errors
|===

*Testing the Exit Codes:*

[width="100%",cols=""]
|===
| commandA & commandB                | Run commandA and then run commandB (without piping)
| commandA && commandB               | Run commandA, if it succeeds then run commandB
| commandA #||# commandB             | Run commandA, if it fails then run commandB
| commandA && commandB #||# commandC | If commandA succeeds run commandB, but if it fails run commandC
|===

An Exit Code of 0 (zero) means success.
Any other Exit Code means failure.

The general pattern of use is:

[source,bash]
----
type originalfile.txt | your-command | another-filter-tool | type
type originalfile.txt | your-command | another-filter-tool > newfile.txt
----

The `type` command (in Windows) is a dead-simple command that reads the contents of the named file and pumps it into `stdout`.
(In fact, the `<` notation is just a shortcut for invoking the type command.
So, `type file | command` and `command < file` mean the exact same thing.)
Using `type` is just an example.
There are any number of commands/tools that could start off the filter chain.

The `|` symbol says to take the `stdout` from the previous tool (`type`) and pipe in into the `stdin` for the next tool, `your-command` in this case.

Your tool then takes what it gets through `stdin`, filters it, and writes the processed data to `stdout`.

The second `|` symbol says to take the `stdout` from your tool and send it on to the `stdin` of the next command in the chain (e.g. a sorting tool, a search-and replace tool, a word counting tool, etc.)

In the first example, we pipe the final output to the type command, which sends it to the console.
In the second example, we write the final output to newfile.txt.

=== How `stderr` Comes into Play

If your tool needs to convey some information about what it's doing, it'll send those messages down a separate channel known as `stderr`.
(`stderr` is really misnamed.
It should be something like "`stdinfo`" since it can communicate more information than just errors.)

By default, messages that are sent down the `stderr` channel go directly to the console.
But that assumes that they are watching it run.
They could be running your tool unattended.
In that case, they'll want to redirect `stderr` somewhere else.
For that, use `2>` instead of `>`.

[source,bash]
----
type originalfile.txt > your-command > newfile.txt 2> errors.log
----

The processed output still goes to newfile.txt, while any information about how the data was processed (or not) will go to a separate file, `errors.log` instead of to the console.

BTW, `>` is shorthand for `1>`. They mean the same thing. 1 refers to `stdout`. 2 refers to `stderr`.

On occasion, you might want to combine `stdout` and `stderr` on purpose.
That way, the diagnostic messages will be interwoven with the processed data and you'll be able to see at what point in the processing the errors/warnings occur.

To do this, there's a special notation to the combine the `stdout` channel (#1) with the `stderr` channel (#2).

[source,bash]
----
type originalfile.txt > your-command 1> combined.txt 2>&1
----

The `&1` says to take the `stderr` channel and just send the information to the same place that `1>` is sending the `stdout` data (namely, `combined.txt`).

Another option is if you don't care about the `stderr` pipe at all, then you can send it nowhere.

[source,bash]
----
type originalfile.txt > your-command 1> newfile.txt 2> nul
----

`nul` is the name of a special "`device`" that simply ignores whatever it receives through `stdin`.
