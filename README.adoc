This is the GruntWurk Core for Python -- a framework for desktop (and mobile?) apps.
It provides support for any type of Python project, especially:

* Headless apps (command-Line only tools).
* Any project that calls for: logging, standardized exit codes, command-line options, INI configs.
* Any project that needs asset ("theme") management: icon sets, images, color schemes (main "skin" and/or syntax highlighting), keyboard mapping, and fonts -- no matter which GUI framework is used.

NOTE: Two additional libraries, GWPyQT4 and GWKivy, provide support for apps that use either PyQT4 or Kivy for the GUI, respectively.

== Screen Shots

// TODO Extract to GWPyQT4

Showing off just one small aspect of GWPyCore, here are a couple of example color schemes ("skins").
These two were pulled from the 150+ schemes available at http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/[Chris Kempson's "`base16`" project].
These are just out-of-the-box. Selected skins can be tweaked to better suit the actual application.
Shown are the demo application along with the skin inspector.
Repeatedly pressing F9 will cycle through the many schemes so that you can quickly find a few that you like (as a starting point) to fit your particular application.

Things to notice:

* The icons change color along with everything else.
* The tool bars are dockable (A basic feature of QT)
* Two of the example icons change state (on/off) -- the main menu visibility, and the word-wrap.
* The out-of-the-box skins use just the 16 colors in the scheme directly, but the "computed background" colors are also immediately available to your application, as appropriate.

== What's in GruntWurk Core for Python?

This library is divided into a few sections: the general framework, the GUI support, data classes and utility functions.

=== The General Framework ("gw_basis")

* Command-Line Support (building on the standard `argparse` library)
* Config file support (building on the standard `configparser` library)
* Advanced logging (building on the standard `logging` library)
* Advanced exception handling (with coordinated exit code support)
* (Incubating) Versioning Support

=== GUI Support

* Skin Asset Management (app color schemes)
* Syntax Asset Management (syntax highlighting color schemes)
* KeyMap Asset Management
* Icon Asset Management (plus SVG colorizing support)
* (Incubating) Font Asset Management
* (Incubating) Image Asset Management


=== Data Classes

* Classic Tree Structure (Nodes)
* (Incubating) Basic Fuzzy Logic

=== Utility Functions

* Color Manipulation
* DateTime (e.g. date_from_vague_parts(), and interpret_date_range("YESTERDAY"))
* Numeric Functions
* String Functions
* Phonetic Alphabet Functions
* Windows-Specific Functions (e.g. installing a TTF font, printing a PDF).

NOTE: This library was developed in Python 3.8 on Windows 10.
Everything should work in Python 3.6 and/or on non-Windows boxes, but no guarantees either way.

== Cookie-Cutter Templates

(Incubating) "`Cookie-cutter`" templates will be provided to jump-start your projects.




== Feature Details

*Project Setup Tools/Frameworks (gw_basis folder):*

* gw_cli.py -- Command-Line-Interface tools (argparse helpers).
* gw_config.py -- INI configuration tools (configparser helpers).
* gw_exceptions.py -- Base exception classes that are logging-friendly and with exitcode standardization.
* gw_logging.py -- Extends basic Python logging with 2 added levels (DIAGNOSTIC, TRACE), incorporates colorlog, and other features.
* gw_versioning.py -- For help with bumping/tracking version numbers.

*User-Interface (gw_gui folder):*
// TODO Extract to GWPyQT4

* gw_gui_simple_cp.py -- A base class for creating a "simple control panel"
* gw_gui_q_line_edit.py -- A subclass of QLineEdit that allows for deselecting.
* gw_gui_finger_tabs.py
* gw_gui_kay_map.py -- A manager for QActions, including loading them from a key map in a CSV file.
* gw_gui_dialogs.py --QT-based message dialogs that are logging-friendly: inform_user_about_issue(), ask_user_to_confirm(), and ask_user_to_choose().

*General Utility Functions:*

* gw_datetime.py -- from_month_name(), timestamp().
* gw_strings.py -- strip_blank_lines(), rstrip_special(), leading_spaces_count(), normalize_name().
* gw_alphabet.py -- PHONETIC_LIST, PHONETIC_DICT, phonetic_spelling().

*Windows Specific (gw_windows_specific folder):*

* gw_fonts.py -- Installing a TTF or OTF font in Windows.
* gw_winodws_behavior.py -- disableWindowTracking().
* gw_winodws_printing.py -- fill_in_pdf(), view_pdf(), print_pdf().
