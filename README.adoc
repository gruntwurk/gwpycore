This is the GruntWurk Core for Python -- a framework for desktop apps.
It provides support for any type of Python project, especially:

* Apps that use Qt for the GUI as well as headless apps (command-Line only tools).
* Any project that calls for: logging, standardized exit codes, command-line options, INI configs.
* Any project that needs asset ("theme") management: icon sets, images, color schemes (main "skin" and/or syntax highlighting), keyboard mapping, and fonts.

== Screen Shots

Here are a couple of example color schemes ("skins").
These two were pulled from the 150+ schemes available at http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/[Chris Kempson's "`base16`" project]. 
These are just out-of-the-box. Selected skins can be tweaked to better suit the actual application.
Shown are the demo application along with the skin inspector.
Repeatedly pressing F9 will cycle through the many schemes so that you can quickly find a few that you like (as a starting point) to fit your particular application.

Things to notice:

* The icons change color along with everything else.
* The tool bars are dockable (A basic feature of QT)
* Two of the example icons change state (on/off) -- the main menu visibility, and the word-wrap.
* The out-of-the-box skins use just the 16 colors in the scheme directly, but the "computed background" colors are also immediately available to your application, as appropriate.

== Other Features

It also contains a collection of one-off "housekeeping" functions like installing a TTF font in Windows.

NOTE: This library was developed in Python 3.8 on Windows 10.
Everything should work in Python 3.6 and/or on non-Windows boxes, but no guarantees either way.

== What's in GruntWurk Core for Python?

*Project Setup Tools/Frameworks (gw_basis folder):*

* gw_cli.py -- Command-Line-Interface tools (argparse helpers).
* gw_config.py -- INI configuration tools (configparser helpers).
* gw_exceptions.py -- Base exception classes that are logging-friendly and with exitcode standardization.
* gw_logging.py -- Extends basic Python logging with 2 added levels (DIAGNOSTIC, TRACE), incorporates colorlog, and other features.
* gw_versioning.py -- For help with bumping/tracking version numbers.

*User-Interface (gw_gui folder):*

* gw_gui_simple_cp.py -- A base class for creating a "simple control panel"
* gw_gui_q_line_edit.py -- A subclass of QLineEdit that allows for deselecting.
* gw_gui_finger_tabs.py
* gw_gui_kay_map.py -- A manager for QActions, including loading them from a key map in a CSV file.
* gw_gui_dialogs.py --QT-based message dialogs that are logging-friendly: inform_user_about_issue(), ask_user_to_confirm(), and ask_user_to_choose().

*General Utility Functions:*

* gw_datetime.py -- from_month_name(), timestamp().
* gw_strings.py -- strip_blank_lines(), rstrip_special(), leading_spaces_count(), normalizeName().
