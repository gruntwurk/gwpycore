This is the *GruntWurk for Python Core module* -- a practical, non-intrusive framework for desktop and mobile apps.
This package is intended to be used directly by apps of any nature, as well as supporting the other packages in the "GruntWurk for Python" series.
By "non-intrusive," we mean that nothing is forced.
This library plays nice with other frameworks.
You are free to pick and choose the library elements that suit your needs and ignore the rest.
For example, you don't have to use Python's built-in `argParser` library to process your command line interface, but if you do, then `gwpycore` has helpers for that.


== You Are Here

The GruntWurk for Python family includes:

* `gwpycore` -- Core classes and functions that augment fundamental features of Python. *<- You Are Here*
* `gwpykivy` -- Helpers for Kivy/KivyMD (GUI framework)
* `gwpyqt5` -- Helpers for PyQT5 (GUI framework)
* `gwpyreportlab` -- Helpers for ReportLab (PDF framework)
* `gwpyautomate` -- Misc. utility code for personal productivity automation.
* `gwpylibre` --  Misc. utility code for automating Libre Office.

Other GruntWurk projects of interest to Python Developers:

* `general-tools` -- BASH script tools/libraries for building Linux boxes (e.g. *RaspberryPi* boxes; virtual machines via *Vagrant*), a reference library of *cheat sheets*, and more.
* `vscode-python` -- a *Visual Studio Code plugin* with 100's of commands and snippets for working with plain Python as well as these "GruntWurk for Python" enhancements.
* `sublime_gruntwurk_python` -- a *SublimeText 4* plugin with commands and snippets for working with plain Python as well as these "GruntWurk for Python" enhancements.


== The GruntWurk Mission

The GruntWurk mission is to support open-source Python projects by making it easy for potential new contributors to jump on board.
As the name implies, we aim to take the grunt-work out of project development, hiding away the complexities so that contributors can immediately get down to business.
The shorter the learning curve, the easier it is for contributors to join in.


== Values

. Simplicity.
. Respect.
. Communication.
. Feedback.
. Reliability.

The first four are straight out of "`eXtreme Programming Explained`" (Kent Beck, 1999).
XP is the "`OG`" of agile software development.
When Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, and the rest fail (which they do frequently and spectacularly), it's because they stray from these core values.


== Strategies and Tactics

. Our #1 strategy towards fulfilling this mission is to start with *tried-and-true Python facilities* (`ArgParser`, `ConfigParser`, built-in `Logging`, etc.) -- because they are familiar to most Python programmers -- and then work to simplify their usage.
But, again, nothing is forced.
You can pick and choose alternatives for any or all of these facilities.

. For boilerplate code, *we prefer libraries* of classes and functions *over collections of code snippets/templates*.
Snippets are great and we use them too, but code that is centralized is easier to maintain, easier to test, and easier to document.

. We know it's important that this library *exemplifies clean, Pythonic, easily understandable code.*
** We follow the usual Python practices (such as using opinionated linters and formatters).
** We maintain the API docs to be as thorough and accurate as possible (erring on the side of verbosity).
** We actively remove (or deprecate) dead code, so as not to be confusing.
** We use `TODO` and `FIXME` comments generously.
** (TODO what else?)

. Regarding our value of *Reliability,*  we've seen too many worthy projects on GitHub abandoned by their originators (for whatever reason).
The "GruntWurk" organization was created on github specifically with "continuity of business" in mind.
Anyone interested in becoming an alternate custodian of these GruntWurk projects is welcome to apply.
We aim to ensure that these projects are well-supported and trustworthy, with someone responsible always at the helm.

== Features

This `gwpycore` package offers support for *headless apps* (command-Line only tools) as well as *GUI apps* (using the GUI framework of your choice).

=== General Application Support

* *Command-line* support (`gw_cli.py`) -- building on the standard `argparse` library.
* *Config file* support (`gw_config.py`) -- building on the standard `configparser` library.
* Advanced *logging* (`gw_logging.py`) -- building on the standard `logging` library.
* Advanced *exception handling* (`gw_exceptions.py`) -- with coordinated *exit-code* support.

=== General GUI Support (regardless of the actual GUI framework used)

* Skin Asset Management (app color schemes)
* Syntax Asset Management (syntax highlighting color schemes)
* KeyMap Asset Management
* Icon Asset Management (plus SVG colorizing support)
* (Incubating) Font Asset Management
* (Incubating) Image Asset Management

=== Data Classes

* Classic Tree Structure (Nodes)
* (Incubating) Basic Fuzzy Logic

=== Colors

* A `NamedColor` enum with 500+ standard colors and easy ways to manipulate them.

=== Dates and Times

* `date_from_vague_parts()`
* `interpret_date_range("YESTERDAY"))`
* `from_month_name()`
* `timestamp()` -- A simple string with the current date/time (e.g. to add it to a file name).

=== Strings

* `strip_blank_lines()`
* `rstrip_special()` -- A version of str.rstrip() that's not as aggressive.
* `leading_spaces_count()` -- (Used by tab-to-spaces converter code, for example.)
* `normalize_name()` -- Replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores.

=== Numeric Functions

* `next_in_range()`
*
=== Windows Specific

* `gw_fonts.py` -- Installing a TTF or OTF font in Windows.
* `gw_winodws_behavior.py` -- `disableWindowTracking()`.
* `gw_winodws_printing.py` -- `fill_in_pdf()`, `view_pdf()`, `print_pdf()`.



== Cookie-Cutter Templates

(Incubating) "`Cookie-cutter`" templates will be provided to jump-start your projects.

See also our `vscode-python` project and our `sublime_grunwurk_python` project -- plugins for Visual Studio Code and SublimeText, respectively.


== Be Aware

NOTE: This library was developed in Python 3.8 on Windows 10.
Everything should work in Python 3.6 and/or on non-Windows boxes, but no guarantees either way.
