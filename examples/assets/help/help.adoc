= Asset Management Demonstration

== The Standard Help Action

. The standard help action handler is showing you this information because it found a file called `help.html` in the `help` subfolder of the assets root folder (namely, `examples/assets/help/help.html`).

. If there was no such file, then the standard help action handler would next check to see if there is a configuration setting for `documentation_url`.
If so, it would open that URL in the system's default browser.

. If it finds neither, then it displays the not-implemented dialog.
