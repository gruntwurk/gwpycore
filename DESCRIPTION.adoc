This is the *GruntWurk for Python Core module* -- a practical, non-intrusive framework for desktop and mobile apps.
This package is intended to be used directly by apps of any nature, as well as supporting the other packages in the "GruntWurk for Python" series.
By "non-intrusive," we mean that nothing is forced.
This library plays nice with other frameworks.
You are free to pick and choose the library elements that suit your needs and ignore the rest.
For example, you don't have to use Python's built-in `argParser` library to process your command line interface, but if you do, then `gwpycore` has helpers for that.
