= Tips for Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

== Keyboard Bindings

You can easily remap the keyboard bindings to be the same (well, similar, anyway) as your favorite editor (Vim, Sublime, IntelliJ, Notepad++, etc.)

	File > Preferences > Keymaps

This will install a corresponding extension. In the case of the Sublime extension, for example, it finds your current Sublime settings and (tries to) replicates them.

After that, you can refine the bindings, one-by-one:

	File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts

== The Python Extension

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing for a summary of what VSCode's Python extension does for you.

== Snippets

VSCode has an internal system for working with snippets that is very much the same as Textmate/Sublime. 

	File > Preferences > User Snippets > Python

Some snippet files are included here (in doc_technical/VSCode_Snippets).

There is also built-in support for Emmet, a unique snippet processor for generating HTML and CSS code based on CSS syntax. See http://emmet.io for an explanation.
